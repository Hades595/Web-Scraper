# Web-Scraper
This is a simple web-scraper for finding news articles in cybersecurity news websites.

This is part of a three-step process of creating an android app which spits out cyber news articles,
so you don't have to go and visit each of websites individually.  

* Step 1: Create a Web-scraper.

* Step 2: Create a Database.

* Step 3: Create the Android App. 

Currently, the web-scraper sorts the articles via the dates in the URLS.
Need to work on a better solution as it is not very accurate.
